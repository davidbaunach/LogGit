    <h2>What Is LogGit:</h2>
    <p>Nothing new, it's just using Git and publically hosted repositories to distribute content in a way that is offline-first, p2p if you want, and doesn't rely on anything other than a personal computer if you want to go old school. Oh, and you don't have to build anything, it's good to go.</p>
    <p>This whole project is just giving it a name and a logo so it's easier to talk about it.</p>
    <h2>How To LogGit:</h2>
    <p>Step 1. Host the repository to your website or whatever you want to share publicly on Github or something.</p>
    <p>Step 2. If you can, place the logo and the url to clone that repository prominently on the site or whatever it is you're sharing.</p>
    <p>Step 3. Tell your friends they can get your project via LogGit.</p>
    <p>Step 4. Congratulate yourself on making the world a more offline-friendly place!</p>

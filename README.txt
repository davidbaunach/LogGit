LogGit: using Git to achieve local-first, offline-first, p2p, decentralized, verifiable, editable, content distribution.

Abstract: make use of git and publicly hosted repositories to distribute text and images and video.

Git is already used to distribute code and programs in this way, it just takes a simple paradigm shift to start distributing text and images and video in this way.

It allows for the use of already existent programs and services, nothing new needs to be done for it to work, though new programs can be made to streamline the process and make it more approachable to those less technically inclined.

This repository will contain documentation on LogGit, how to use Git in order to collect and distribute human creativity in the various formats that can be accessed with computers.

Credits: writings by solderpunk on Gemini, elavoie and various others on SSB, and probably a ton of others I cannot now recall. This is not a new idea, just my attempt to synthesize and make it simple.

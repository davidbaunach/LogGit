<h1>LogGit:</h1>
<h2>using Git to achieve local-first, offline-first, p2p, decentralized, verifiable, editable, content distribution.</h2>
<p>Abstract: make use of git and publicly hosted repositories to distribute text, audio, images, and video.</p>
<p>The problem: we use a lot of resources with the client-server model, and once the connection goes down, only sadness remains.</p>
<p>The solution: use the server as little as necessary, do as much as you can on your device.</p>
<p>Use Git.</p>
<p>Version control, yes, but more importantly, already optimized for p2p and sneakernet.</p>
<p>It allows for collaboration.</p>
<p>You can take a project someone else started, and finish it.</p>
<p>There's already a whole bunch of gui programs available on all major operating systems to track and manage repositories, nothing needs to be built to start. It's ready to go.</p>
<p>Most people are hosting the repo for their static site on some Git forge already, you can track it down, or maybe more people can start sharing the url to clone the repo.</p>
<p>Git does have size limitations: so you need to break up bigger projects.</p>
<p>And even before you get to those, in order to make it easier to clone, keeping projects small and modular helps keep things manageable.</p>
<p>You're already doing cool stuff, just start sharing it with Git; and RSS, ATOM, siloed social networks, and unwieldy Wordpress blogs become an unecessary relic of a more fragile past.</p>
<p>Here's some of the sources where this idea is discussed by those much smarter than me:</p>

<p>Ian Clarke and the Freenet project (again, too much to archive here) https://freenet.org/</p>
<p>And many more I'll add as I can.</p>
